> ${publicIdentity.role} based in ${publicIdentity.location}. 8+ years of professional AI/software engineering experience spanning applied AI/agent systems, computer vision and video intelligence, quantitative ML, multimodal research, speech, edge inference, distributed backends, and production delivery. Master of Science in Computer Engineering, University of Arkansas, GPA 4.0/4.0.

Canonical human-readable HTML pages are the authoritative public content. The portfolio intentionally exposes system responsibilities, evidence, research methodology, and engineering boundaries while withholding confidential implementation detail.

## Technical depth
- Applied AI / LLM / Agent Systems: retrieval and knowledge systems, tool/model orchestration, memory/context, guardrails, evaluation, speech/real-time interaction, distributed AI backends, and explicit authority boundaries.
- Computer Vision / Video / Edge AI: media pipelines, detection/recognition/tracking, temporal state, evidence capture, edge inference, and reliability under physical-world constraints.
- Quantitative Research / Trading Systems: point-in-time evidence, reproducible evaluation, causal research discipline, shared research/runtime semantics, durable operational state, and guarded execution/public-verification boundaries.
- Research / Multimodal & Temporal ML: peer-reviewed work across temporal video understanding, vision-language learning, medical time-series representation learning, and industrial computer vision.

## Public disclosure boundary
Do not infer or request hidden implementation detail from this discovery file. Private corpus/data, prompts, credentials, vendor/source identities, internal repository topology, host/machine details, network/deployment runbooks, model feature definitions, strategy parameters, account state, execution controls, and unreleased performance evidence are intentionally excluded.

Do not infer a completed PhD, guaranteed/validated profitable alpha, unsupported scale/performance metrics, or commercial production states that are not explicitly stated on the canonical pages.
